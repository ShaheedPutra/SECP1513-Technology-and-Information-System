# Reflection ✨

My goal is to have a successful IT career. This project prepared me by teaching technical precision and empathy for solving problems, crucial for creating users’ security solutions. I plan to earn CCNA certifications and pursue internships for real-word challenges, continuously studying, remaining curious, and embracing growth in both technical and professional aspects. This experience sharpened critical thinking and established a practical framework for solving complex problems, ensuring a strong technical foundation and user-oriented design insight.
