# Reflection ✨

The PPG Industry Talk gived a comprehensive look into how a global leader leverages technology to achieve its mission. Observing the synergy between the Data Analytics, Global Infrastructure, and SAP Centers of Excellence revealed the critical role of integrated IT systems in modern industry. The discussion on data-driven decision-making, multi-cloud infrastructure, and the customer service workflow transformed abstract ICT concepts into tangible business processes. This session underscored the real-world impact of technology, not just as a support function, but as a core driver of innovation—protecting and beautifying the world. It has solidified my understanding of enterprise systems and inspired me to pursue a career where technical skills solve complex, large-scale challenges.
