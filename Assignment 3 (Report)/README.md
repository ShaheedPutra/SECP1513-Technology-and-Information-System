# Reflection ✨

Based on the talk, I learned that I should not rely 100% on AI for my work, especially for my final year project. It is a tool, not a replacement for my own understanding and effort. I also realized that social skills are crucial, as real-world work is almost always done in teams, not alone. Furthermore, I must always keep learning new things because the IT field is vast and constantly evolving. Staying curious and updating my skills is essential to avoid falling behind and to secure a good job in the future. In short, the key is balancing technical skill with continuous learning and teamwork.
