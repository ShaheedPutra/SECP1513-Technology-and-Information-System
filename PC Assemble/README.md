# Reflection ✨

The PC assemble lab was a grounding experience that transformed my theoretical knowledge into tactile understanding. While disassembling the cover, RAM, hard disk, cooling fan and power supply, I realized that hardware is both robust and incredibly fragile. The most challenging part was the wiring, reassembling the system taught me that logical organization is just as important as technical skill, as a single loose connection can prevent a boot-up.

To improve, I suggest including a cable management challenge to teach how neatness affects airflow and cooling.
